If (like me) you don't work with spatial data much, you might assume that you only need the shapefile, and you might delete the others that come with the folder. However, a shapefile is not just a single .shp file, but a collection of files that work together, and each of these files plays a crucial role in defining the shapefile's data and behaviour. When you try and read a shapefile into a coding editor, the software expects all components to be present, and missing them can lead to errors or incorrect spatial references. E.g. without the .dbf file, you'd lose all attribute data associated with the geographic features, and without the .shx file you might not be able to read the .shp file altogether. \n",

    "Now that we've set up our map with our base CartoDB positron tiles, we can now use Folium's choropleth function to plot our geometries onto the uk_map. The function below has a lot of parameters that we need to specify, including:\n",
